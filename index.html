                 <p>
                    <b>Study Subject:</b> In the first year, I have studied plankton dynamics 
                    in space with different parametrisation of functional responses. We have 
                    published one paper and I have led seminars related to this subject. After 
                    the first year, we have started bacteriophage model in well-mixed space 
                    and heterogeneous space. We have also published a paper on this subject. 
                    In addition, I have presented the poster and talk on this subject at 
                    some conferences.

        <h3>Teaching</h3>
        <p>
            I have training related to teaching and providing formative 
            feedback. I have improved my teaching skills while working 
            as a teaching assistant and as a volunteer
        </p>
        <h3>Time management</h3>
        <p>
            Completing PhD within 3 years is very important and I did.
             I have also published two international papers and we 
             will publish a paper soon. I did my PhD with teaching 
             and invigilation.
